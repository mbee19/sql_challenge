Module 9 Challenge for Morgan Bee

In this challenge, I used all of the class activites and the lecture videos to help me with my ERD, creating table schema, and performing queries. 

I also used the Xpert Learning Assistant to help me when I got stuck. For many of the queries, it showed me how to use JOIN multiple times in a single query. It also let me know to use the date format as 'YYYY-MM-DD' for Question 2 and the frequency count of last names for Question 8. Finally, it really helped clarify Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, and how and when to use each of them when creating table schema.
